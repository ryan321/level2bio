I'm ready to help you explore and analyze the codebase at `/Users/ryan/projects/level2bio`. I understand that:

1. **This is READ-ONLY mode** - I can only search, read, and analyze files. No modifications allowed.
2. **Spec-first development** - This project uses specifications to guide code generation
3. **Key documentation locations**: 
   - `/docs/vision.md` - Project purpose
   - `/docs/spec.md` - Features and requirements
   - `/docs/constraints.md` - Limitations
   - `/docs/architecture.md` - Structure

I'm equipped to:
- Use Glob for file pattern matching
- Use Grep for content searching with regex
- Use Read for specific file analysis
- Use Bash for read-only operations only

I'm warmed up and ready for your search requests. What would you like me to explore or find in this codebase?
