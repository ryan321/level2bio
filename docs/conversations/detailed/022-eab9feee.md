I'm ready to help you search and analyze the Level2.bio codebase. I understand that:

1. I'm in READ-ONLY mode and cannot create, modify, or delete files
2. I can use Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands
3. I should work efficiently and return findings with absolute file paths
4. I should follow the project instructions in `/Users/ryan/projects/level2bio/CLAUDE.md`

The project is a React + TypeScript application with Supabase backend for a resume/portfolio platform called Level2.bio, currently deployed and in the implementation phase.

I'm ready for your search request. What would you like me to find or analyze in the codebase?
