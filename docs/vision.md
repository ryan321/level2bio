# Level2.bio

> Your resume's second layer — a private space to explain your work in depth and share it only when you choose.

## One-Liner

Level2.bio gives job seekers a private, structured way to explain the "why" and "how" behind their work, giving hiring managers the context they wish they had upfront.

## Problem

Modern hiring is broken by shallow signals:

- **Resumes reduce people to bullet points.** Complex, meaningful work gets compressed into one-line summaries that all look the same.
- **Recruiters screen in 7-10 seconds.** There's no room for nuance, context, or personality.
- **Interviews barely scratch the surface.** By the time a candidate can explain their thinking, hours of everyone's time have been spent.
- **Great candidates look average on paper.** Without brand-name companies or obvious keywords, strong talent gets overlooked.

Candidates have no good way to go deeper:

- **LinkedIn** is too public, too shallow, and too performative
- **Portfolio sites** take too much effort and lack structure
- **Loom videos** feel awkward and unguided
- **Notion pages** are walls of text that hiring managers won't read
- **GitHub** only shows code, not communication or reasoning

Nothing lets candidates explain the *why* and *how* behind their work — privately, authentically, and on their own terms.

## Solution

Level2.bio gives candidates a private, structured space to tell the real story behind their work.

- **Work stories, not bullet points.** Guided templates help candidates explain what they did, why it mattered, and what they learned.
- **Video that feels natural.** Candidates can record themselves walking through projects — no time limits, no performative pressure.
- **Private by default.** Content is only accessible via a unique link the candidate controls. They can revoke or regenerate it anytime.
- **Built for hiring managers.** A clean, skimmable format that delivers deep context in minutes, not hours.

It's the missing layer between a resume and an interview.

## Target Users

### Primary: Job Seekers (Candidates)
People who want to stand out and go deeper than their resume allows. They create profiles, craft work stories, and control who sees them.

### Secondary: Hiring Managers / Recruiters (Viewers)
They receive Level2 links and use them to evaluate candidates more efficiently. They don't need accounts — they just view what candidates share.

### Not For
- Passive job seekers who aren't actively trying to stand out
- Companies looking for a job board or candidate database
- Anyone wanting a public social profile

## Success Criteria

### Near-term (v1)
- [ ] Candidates can create a work story and share it via private link
- [ ] Hiring managers report getting useful context they wouldn't have gotten from a resume
- [ ] Candidates feel comfortable sharing things they wouldn't put on LinkedIn

### Long-term (if v1 succeeds)
- [ ] "Level2" becomes a verb: "Before we bring them on-site, Level2 them."
- [ ] Job applications routinely include Level2.bio links
- [ ] ATS systems add Level2.bio as a standard field
- [ ] Candidates without traditional pedigrees break through because they can *show* their value

## Non-Goals

Level2.bio is intentionally focused. We are **not** building:

- **A social network** — No feeds, followers, likes, comments, or public profiles
- **A job board or marketplace** — No job postings, matching algorithms, or recruiter outreach tools
- **A portfolio builder** — No drag-and-drop editors, custom themes, or multi-page websites
- **An AI scoring system** — No automated candidate ranking, skill assessment, or resume parsing
- **A code hosting platform** — No repos, code browsing, or technical analysis
- **Invasive analytics** — No heatmaps, session tracking, or creepy behavioral data

## Key Differentiators

| Alternative | Why it falls short | Level2.bio difference |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| LinkedIn | Public, shallow, performative | Private, deep, authentic |
| Portfolio sites | Too much effort, no guidance | Structured templates, quick to create |
| Loom videos | Awkward, unstructured, not private | Guided format, privacy controls |
| Notion pages | Walls of text, inconsistent | Skimmable, video-first option |
| GitHub | Code only, no soft skills | Explains thinking, not just output |

## Future Possibilities

These are explicitly out of scope for v1, but could be explored if the core proves valuable:

- **AI-assisted clarity tools** — Help candidates express themselves more clearly (not grade or score them)
- **Role-specific templates** — Tailored story flows for engineers, designers, PMs, etc.
- **Built-in video recording** — Record directly in-browser
- **Hiring manager tools** — Private collections, internal notes, ATS integrations
- **Team/org versions** — Internal work stories for onboarding, retrospectives, knowledge sharing
- **Verified achievements** — Opt-in, minimal credibility markers (education, employment)
- **Multi-modal storytelling** — Voice-only stories, interactive timelines, mobile-native versions
