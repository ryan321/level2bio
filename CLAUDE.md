# Project Name

> One-line description of what this project does.

## Quick Start

This project uses spec-first development. Code is generated from specifications, not written ad-hoc.

**Key commands:**
- `/interview-project` - Start a new project (run this first)
- `/implement` - Implement a feature from spec
- `/commit` - Review and commit changes
- `/audit` - Full project health check

## Documentation

All specs live in `/docs`. Consult before making changes:
- `docs/vision.md` - Why this exists, who it's for
- `docs/spec.md` - What it does (features, requirements)
- `docs/constraints.md` - Hard limits and non-negotiables
- `docs/architecture.md` - How it's structured
