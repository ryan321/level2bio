# Level2.bio

> Your resume's second layer — a private space to explain your work in depth and share it only when you choose.

## What is Level2.bio?

Level2.bio gives job seekers a private, structured way to tell the real story behind their work. Candidates create "work stories" that explain the *why* and *how* behind their experience, then share them via a single private link they control.

**For candidates**: Go deeper than bullet points. Explain your thinking, show your communication skills, and share things you couldn't put on LinkedIn — all privately.

**For hiring managers**: Get the context you wish you had before scheduling interviews. Understand a candidate's reasoning and impact in minutes, not hours.

## The Problem

Modern hiring is broken by shallow signals:

- Resumes reduce complex work to one-line bullets
- Recruiters screen in 7-10 seconds
- Great candidates look average on paper
- LinkedIn is too public and performative
- Portfolios take too much effort to build
- Loom videos feel awkward and unguided

## The Solution

Level2.bio is the missing layer between a resume and an interview:

- **Work stories, not bullet points** — Guided templates help you explain what you did, why it mattered, and what you learned
- **Video that feels natural** — Walk through projects in your own words, no time limits
- **Private by default** — Share via a unique link you control; revoke anytime
- **Built for skimming** — Clean, professional format hiring managers can review in minutes

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Auth**: LinkedIn OAuth

## Project Status

Currently in the **Discovery** phase. Core documentation complete:

- [x] Vision and product definition
- [x] Feature specification
- [x] Technical constraints
- [ ] Architecture design
- [ ] Implementation
- [ ] Launch

## Documentation

- [`docs/vision.md`](docs/vision.md) — Why this exists, who it's for
- [`docs/spec.md`](docs/spec.md) — Features, user flows, acceptance criteria
- [`docs/constraints.md`](docs/constraints.md) — Technical limits and privacy principles

## Development

This project uses spec-first development with Claude Code.
